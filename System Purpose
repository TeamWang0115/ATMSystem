Therefore, an ATM system greatly saved the time for customers and employees. It improves the word efficiency for the bank also is very 
convenient for customers.
2. For the students 
   For us, a design of ATM system is really a challenge. How to apply the knowledge learnt in the class and notebooks to the practice, 
that help us to improve our ability, including cooperation 、analysis and coding ability. Besides, the ATM system consists of so many 
functionalities and actors, how they interact with each other, which has to be familiar with object oriented. Analyze the whole system 
by dividing several classes will make the system modular and have clear logic. After the practice, we can make a progress in the study 
and have a deep understanding to this course.
